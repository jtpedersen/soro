* Relayboard


I have installed an 8-channel relay board to control various power
things.


In [[file:wiring.org]] there is a "schematic" the basic idea is that from
the 6 outputs on the mesa board there is a network cable and the first
two relays also have slave relays.

So =mesa.relay_00= controls relay 0 and 6

The intention is to control power to both spindle water cooling and
dust collection when machine is running. etc



I designed a nice mount board to mount the relay on with wago clips,
hidden cabling and strain-relief for cables.

I still need to create a wall-mount, but I have added a
snap-fit-groove and tested it with the current printed version.
