Alarm LED

flashing times - problem description
------------------------------------
 1  over current
 2  over speed
 3  loose step
 4  over load
 5  driver too hot
 6  over voltage
 7  motor connection error
 8  encoder connection error
 9  low voltage
10  Position deviation is too large

This does not match the manual, which only has  3 entries

The green indicator turns on when power-up. When drive protection is activated,
the red LED blinks periodicity to indicate the errors.
* Red light flashing one of one cycle is over current fault
* A red light flashes 2 times in the cycle is over voltage fault
* The red light flashing 7 times of one cycle is positional deviation is too large

*  Configuration:

 Steps pr rev 800

 | sw 1 | sw2 | sw 3 | sw4 |
 |------+-----+------+-----|
 |    1 |   0 |    0 |   0 |



* Lessons learned
  
** Alarm blink
   It seems like 3 blinks means "lost steps" i saw this when hitting z-axis endstop

   
** When hitting too high accelleration 
   all drivers got 2 blinks

   I suspect a power surge from the PSU.

   Current plan is to run with conservative speed / acc settings

   Consider getting a better / smaller PSU with guranteed 48V ..
