* Soro

Configuration and documentation for my CNC.

Based on a kit from Sorotec, running Linuxcnc with a mesa 7i96
ethernet board.









* TODO [0/6]

  A never ending list of tasks that could be done, when the mood is right

  
** TODO Add fuse to relay board

   For good measure mount the fuse, so any faults are caught before
   triggring the house fuses or creating nice electrical arcs

   
** TODO Create mount for relay board

** TODO Wire up dustcollection to relays

** TODO Mount camera for camera alignment

   See this thread for more information:  [[https://forum.linuxcnc.org/plasmac/40057-camera-for-touchoff]["Camera For Touchoff"]]
   
** TODO Make shelf in cabinet and Move PC into cabinet 
   Why did I ever mount it in a the cupboard on wheels with a long
   thick "umbilical cord"? 

   Use wired network instead of wireless?

   
** TODO Try Qt based ui instead of Axis
